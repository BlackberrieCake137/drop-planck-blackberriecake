# drop-planck-blackberriecake
this is my config for my planck keyboard. Seeing as it has only a small amount of keys, everything has to be crammed into layers while simutaneously you need to make sure you arent making your fingers play twister when trying to press a key

This layout is designed such for a few reasons:
- i like video games, so default qwerty layer is good for making sure games like roblox arent a hassle to play where otherwise I would have to reach all the way across the keyboard to hit "e"
- i am trying to get into vim, so arrow keys are in a vim-like position, such as being the equivalent of `Fn + HJKL` 
- its irresponsible to use spaces in filenames, so `-_` is right next to space key, just generally makes-it-easier-to-do-this
- i type in italian, russian, arabic, and english, so `\[]` should be on the default layer without hiting extra keys and easy to reach.
- `colemak-dh` i have found to be the most comfortable layout so far. Due to the planck's focus on portability, there is a default `colemak-dh` layer provided. This also means `colemak-dh` can be used on windows and android without the need to install extra software that may or may not work.
- - https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/ im crap at markdown so this is the da linky
- the number keys are in a phone-esque shape. This is done instead of a numpad because it would necessitate putting keys for !@# in weird positions, where `^/*()` can be put in their normal places on the upper layer of the keyboard. This is additionally because i presume more and more people are used to typing with a phone numpad than a keyboard numpad.
- - Additionally, plus and minus are next to the numpad for math sake. Making sure theyre in a layout convenient for typing simple equations with one hand is a challenge, however, but its arguably doable even as set up now.
- the first four function keys are on the most easily accessible left thumb layer along with numbers and such. This is because games often employ those keys and so you can "reach" them with one hand just as you would on a normal keyboard. `F6` is right next to `F4` to make it easier to jump to the URL box in web browsers.
- - All other function keys are on a separate layer, as well as all the numbers on the top row like normally
- Easy, one-handed mouse gestures if you're in a mouse-less pinch.
- `PgUp`,`PgDn`, `Home` and `End` are convenient for navigation so theyre on the default level.

To-Dos:
- screw around more
- go to sleep
- take over the world
